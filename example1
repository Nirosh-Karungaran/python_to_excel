Creating a simple workbook with two sheets written in Python. See example1.py
Each sheet will be named, "MySheet1", MySheet2", "MySheet3"--
MySheet1 will contain four columns, titled Number, Price, SalePrice, Savings--
And three rows labled: Apples, Oranges, Bananas

Automating with Python can produce averages for financial information, sorting,
filtering and building charts.

This is a small example of solely creating a workbook from within Python, not in
Excel.
